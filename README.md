## Inspiration
Inspired by UBC's AMS SafeWalk, we wanted to provide a smoother and more efficient user experience for students to get home safe after dark. Using a flow similar to Uber, we are aiming to digitize the process without having to deal with tedious calls and lack of live status.

## What it does
Stride pairs you with walkers, to get you home safe!

## How we built it
React Native, Express JS, MongoDB

## Challenges we ran into
Environment setups were especially tough – setting up mobile development on an Intel Macbook, M1 Macbook and Windows laptop, there were a lot of variation, each creating different and difficult issues.

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
Finishing the app and placing 2nd out of 133 teams!

## What we learned
Rapid mobile development, use of Mongoose data schemas.

## What's next for Stride
Improve the app and hopefully as a first step being able to offer the solution to UBC AMS to improve their SafeWalk program.
